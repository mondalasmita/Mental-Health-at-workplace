Mental Health in the Workplace Kernel
Overview
This GitHub repository contains a comprehensive kernel that focuses on understanding the multifaceted factors influencing mental health in the workplace. The analysis utilizes a 2014 survey dataset measuring attitudes and the frequency of mental health disorders within the tech industry.

Unlike traditional kernels, our approach prioritizes a systematic exploration of mental health, beginning with a detailed explanation of Prostate Cancer and its detection. The discussion seamlessly transitions to the dataset, conducts exploratory data analysis (EDA), and establishes a baseline model.
